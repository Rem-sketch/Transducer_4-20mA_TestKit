# Transducer_4-20mA_TestKit
This test kit is made for educational purpose in order to get better insight of instrumentation op-amp logic concept and 4-20mA measuring process. It is built with Rail-to Rail Op-Amp and XTR116 for 4- 20mA output and compatible with transducer for pressure measurement.
Component List: XTR116, and MCP6021.
Feature: Educational purpose 4-20mA transmitter Transducer test kit  Easy to assembly by hand-soldering  Using Rail-to-Rail op-amp and precision IC  Adjustable for 4-20mA output  double layer PCB.
Inspired by Arduino-forum-user.
